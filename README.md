Debris-2-Debris
===================

`Debris-2-Debris` (`D2D`) is a toolbox that can be used to rapidly search through a catalog of space debris objects to find candidate optimal debris-to-debris transfers. These candidate pairs can be fed into a full-scale optimization problem in the context of mission analysis for an Active Debris Removal (ADR) space mission.

For an example use of this toolbox, take a look at (Kumar et al., 2014).
